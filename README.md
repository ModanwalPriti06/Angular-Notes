# Angular-Notes

## What is Angular?
- Angular is a TypeScript-based component based front-end framework developed by Google for building single-page web applications (SPAs). It uses components, dependency injection, and two-way data binding to create dynamic and scalable web apps.
- A framework building client application in HTML, CSS Javascript/Typescript.

**SPA(Single Page Application):** An app that doesn't need to reload the page during it's use and work with the browswer. 

## Why use
- Give our application a clean structure
- Re-usable lots of Code
- Single page application
- Easy to maintain and Read
- Make our application more testable
1. Two-Way Data Binding – Keeps UI and data in sync automatically.
2. Component-Based Architecture – Reusable and maintainable code.
3. Dependency Injection – Easy to manage services and dependencies.
4. Built-in Routing – Helps build single-page apps with multiple views.
5. TypeScript Support – Better tooling, type checking, and cleaner code.
6. Powerful CLI – Speeds up development with commands for components, services, etc.
7. Cross-Platform – Can build web, mobile, and desktop apps.

## Modules
- A Module is a unit that consists of a separate block to perform specific functionality and enables us to break down the application into smaller chunks.
- In a module, we can export & import the components and services from other modules.
- Modules are created using the @NgModule decorator.
### Types of Modules:
1. Core Module/Root Module:
- Every Angular application must have at least one root module, which is called the AppModule, defined in the app.module.ts file.
- The root module is the top-level module in an Angular application.
- It imports all of the other modules in the application.
2. Feature Module:
- Feature modules are used to group related components, directives, pipes, and services together.
3. Shared Module:
- The most commonly used functionality will be present in the shared module which can be imported by the feature module whenever needed.

```
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } 
    from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppRoutingModule }
    from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        AppRoutingModule
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

## Components
- A Component is the building block of the angular application.
- A component consists of a template(HTML view of UI), styles(CSS appearance/design) and a typescript class which contains business logic.
- To indicate a class as component @Component decorator is used.
- The @Component decorator provides metadata to the component.
- The component metadata properties consist of selectors, directives, providers, styleUrls and templateUrls.
```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
    title = 'AngularApp';
}
```
## Templates
- The user interface or the view of the end users is defined using the template.
- Templates are created using HTML and it binds the component properties and methods thus helping us to render data dynamically.
- Template syntax includes directives, interpolation, built-in directives, template expression operators, property binding, and event binding for creating dynamic and interactive views.
```
<h2>Welcome to GeeksForGeeks</h2>
<p>Angular Architecture consists of :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Modules</li>
    <li>Components</li>
    <li>Templates</li>
    <li>Directives</li>
    <li>Services</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection(DI)</li>
    <li>Router</li>
    <li>HTTP Client</li>
    <li>State Management</li>
</ul>
```
## Directives
- Directives are instructions in the DOM (Document Object Model).
- Directives are used in templates to customize the behaviour of the elements.
- Angular provides built-in directives like *ngIf and *ngFor, as well as custom directives created by developers.
### Types of directives:
1. Component Directives
  - These directives are associated with the template(view) of a component.
2. Structural Directives
  - These directives are used to change the structure of the DOM using *ngFor,*ngSwitch and *ngIf.
3. Attribute Directives
  - These directives are used to change the behaviour of the DOM using ngStyle,ngModel and ngClass.
4. Custom Directives
  - We can create custom directives using @Directive decorator and define the desired behaviour in the class.

## Services
- Services are used when specific data or logic needs to be used across different components.
- Services are typically used to centralize data access, HTTP requests, state management, and other common tasks.
- Services are singleton and are registered with Angular's dependency injection system.
- Components can inject services to access their functionality and data.
- command to create:
```ng generate service counter```
```
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root',
})
export class CounterService {
    private count = 0;
    increment(): void {
        this.count++;
    }
    getCount(): number {
        return this.count;
    }
}
```
## Dependency Injection(DI)
- Dependency injection simplifies dependency management, facilitates code reusability and simplifies testing.
- DI is a design pattern which increases the flexibility and modularity of the applications by producing and distributing specific parts of the application to other parts of the application that need them.
- We can inject services, configuration values, and other objects into components and services.
- Components and services can declare their dependencies and have them injected automatically using @Injectable decorator.

## Router
- The Angular Router manages navigation within the application for changing from one view to another view.
- Routes are defined in the app-routing.module.ts file and map to specific components.
- The router also supports route parameters, route guards, and child routes for creating complex navigation structures.
```
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } 
    from '@angular/router';
import { EmployeeListComponent } 
    from './employee-list/employee-list.component';
import { CreateEmployeeComponent } 
    from './create-employee/create-employee.component';
import { UpdateEmployeeComponent } 
    from './update-employee/update-employee.component';
import { EmployeeDetailsComponent } 
    from './employee-details/employee-details.component';
const routes: Routes = [
    { path: 'employees', 
      component: EmployeeListComponent },
    { path: 'create-employee', 
      component: CreateEmployeeComponent },
    { path: '', redirectTo: 'employees', 
      pathMatch: 'full' },
    { path: 'update-employee/:id',
      component: UpdateEmployeeComponent },
    { path: 'employee-details/:id', 
      component: EmployeeDetailsComponent }
];
@NgModule({
    imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
    exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```
## State Management
- State management in angular is achieved using RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript).
- RxJS is used for handling asynchronous operations, such as handling HTTP requests, user interactions, and event-driven programming.
- Streams of data and events are managed by Observables which is provided by RxJS.

## HTTP Client
- HTTP client module in angular is used for making HTTP requests to interact with backend services(API calls) to fetch or send data.
```
import { Component, OnInit } 
    from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } 
    from '@angular/common/http';
@Component({
    selector: 'app-post-list',
    templateUrl: './post-list.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./post-list.component.css'],
})
export class PostListComponent implements OnInit {
    posts: any[] = [];
    constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
    ngOnInit(): void {
        this.http
            .get < any[] > (
            'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
                .subscribe((data) => {
                    this.posts = data;
                });
    }
}
```
# Start Created Angular App
- install node
- instal angular cli - npm install -g @angular/cli  (So If you not using / here then angular cli will be install only for current folder)

# 1. Start Created Angular App
- install node
- instal angular cli - [npm install -g @angular/cli], [sudo npm install @angular/cli]  (So If you not using / here then angular cli will be install only for current folder)
- ng new project_name
- goto vs code and install code path click - shift+cmd+p then enter code and install shell commond
- goto project path in terminal and code . (Now your vs code will be open)
- ng serve ( terminal to run application)

# 2. Steps to Create the Application

1. Step 1 : Install the Angular CLI using the following command
    - npm install -g @angular/cli
2. Step 2: Create a new Angular Project.
    - ng new new-project
    - cd new-project
3. Step 3: To start the application run the following command.
    - ng serve

## Angular CLI 
- Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool provided by Angular to automate and streamline your development workflow.
- The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that is used to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell.

# <app.root></app.root>
- <app-root> is a custom HTML tag (element) defined by Angular. It represents the root component of your Angular application — typically AppComponent. It's component selector of the app component.(Check app.ts file)

# standalone
### In Angular, the standalone: true or standalone: false flag is used in a component’s metadata to indicate whether it is a "standalone" component or not.
- ✅ standalone: true
    - This means the component does not belong to any Angular module (NgModule) and can be used independently.
    - You don’t need to declare it in any NgModule.
    - You can bootstrap it directly using bootstrapApplication(LoginComponent) in main.ts.
- standalone: false (or omitted)
    - This is the default behavior in Angular before standalone components existed.
    - ❗ Must be declared in an NgModule, like this:
```
//ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [LoginComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
| Feature                           | `standalone: true`             | `standalone: false` (default) |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Needs to be declared in NgModule? | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes                         |
| Bootstrappable directly?          | ✅ Yes (`bootstrapApplication`) | ❌ No (use `NgModule` only)    |
| Import dependencies?              | ✅ Uses `imports` array         | ❌ Uses module’s imports       |

### 🎯 When to use?
- ✅ Use standalone: true when you're building modern, lightweight, modular components.
- ✅ Use standalone for micro frontends, dynamic loading, or component libraries.

# Nesting Component
- Have to add custom component in import in app.component.ts. In the example Login is my component.
```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [RouterOutlet, Login],
  templateUrl: './app.html',
  styleUrl: './app.css'
})
```
# Template Property
- In Angular, the template property is used inside the @Component decorator to define the HTML structure of the component inline (within the TypeScript file), instead of using an external file.
 ```
   @Component({
  selector: 'app-welcome',
  template: `<h1>Welcome to My App!</h1>`,  // 👈 inline HTML
})
export class WelcomeComponent {}
```
- If your component is big then use templateUrl instead of template
```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-welcome',
  templateUrl: './welcome.component.html',  // 👈 External HTML file
})
```
# Style Property
- The styles (not style) property in Angular is used in the @Component decorator to define inline CSS styles directly within the TypeScript file.
```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: `<h1>Hello Angular</h1>`,
  styles: [`
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
  `]
})
export class HelloComponent {}
```

# Data Binding
- Data binding in Angular connects the component's TypeScript code and the HTML template, allowing them to communicate and stay in sync.
- Angular provides 4 main types of data binding:
1. Interpolation ({{ }})
2. Property Binding ([property]="value")
3. Event Binding ((event)="handler()")
4. Two-Way Binding ([(ngModel)])

### 1. Interpolation ({{ }})
- Direction: Component ➡️ Template
- Use: To display data from the component in the HTML.
```
// app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Angular App';
}
```
```
<!-- app.component.html -->
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>  <!-- Output: Angular App -->
```
### 2. Property Binding ([property]="value")
- Direction: Component ➡️ Template
- Use: To bind component values to HTML element properties.
```
// ts
imgUrl = 'logo.png';
```
```
// html
<img [src]="imgUrl" />  <!-- Binds src to the component's imgUrl -->
```
### 3. Event Binding ((event)="handler()")
- Direction: Template ➡️ Component
- Use: To handle events like click, input, etc., from HTML and run functions in the component.
```
count = 0;
increment() {
  this.count++;
}
```
```
<button (click)="increment()">Click Me</button>
<p>{{ count }}</p>
```
### 4. Two-Way Binding ([(ngModel)])
- Direction: Component ⬄ Template (Two-Way)
- Use: To sync data both ways — like form inputs.
Requires FormsModule in app.module.ts
```
username = '';
```
```
<input [(ngModel)]="username" placeholder="Enter name" />
<p>Hello, {{ username }}</p>
```

| Type             | Syntax               | Direction        | Purpose                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Interpolation    | `{{ value }}`        | Component → View | Show dynamic text                |
| Property Binding | `[property]="value"` | Component → View | Set element properties           |
| Event Binding    | `(event)="handler"`  | View → Component | Handle DOM events                |
| Two-Way Binding  | `[(ngModel)]="prop"` | Both ways        | Sync input fields with component |


### 5. Class Binding
```
//html
  <button [class.btnHeight]= "fruitName == 'Apple' ">{{fruitName}}</button>
//css
.btnHeight {
    height : 30px;
    width : 80px;
    background-color: chocolate;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
//ts
 fruitName : string = 'Apple'
```
# Style Binding
```
  <button [style.background] = " isActive ? 'green' : 'gold' ">Style Binding</button>
```

### Multiple Binding
```
<button
  [style.background]=" isActive ? 'green' : 'gold' "
  [style.border]=" isActive ? '2px solid red' : '5px dotted black' "
>
  Style Binding
</button>
```

# Event Binding

//html
```
<button (click)="eventButtonClick()">Event Binding</button>
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter Name" (keyup)="keyUpFunc($event)"/>
<input type="text" placeholder="Click Enter then Call function" (keyup.enter)="keyUpFilter($event)"/>  <!-- When click enter button then only call function -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter a then Call function" (keyup.a)="keyUpAFilter($event)"/>  <!-- When click enter a then only call function -->
```
// ts
```
 // Event Binding
  eventButtonClick(){
    console.log('button clicked')
  }
  keyUpFunc(event: any){
    console.log('hii',event.target.value)
  }
  keyUpFilter(event: any){
      console.log(event.target.value)
  }
   keyUpAFilter(event: any){
      console.log(event.target.value)
  }
```

# Template Variable
- A template variable in Angular is a way to reference a DOM element or Angular component directly from the HTML template — without needing to bind or store it in the component's .ts file.

```
<input #usernameInput type="text" />
<button (click)="logUsername(usernameInput.value)">Log</button>
```
Example: 

//html
```
<input type="text" (keyup.enter)="tempVariable(user)" placeholder="Template Variable" #user id="userInputId"/>
```
//ts
```
tempVariable(user: HTMLInputElement){
    console.log(user.value)
  }
```

# Two way Data Binding
- 👉 When the user updates the input field, the component's property updates too
 AND
- 👉 When the component updates the property, the input field updates automatically.
```
 <input placeholder="2 way data binding" type="text" #username [value]= 'username' (keyup.enter)="twoWayDataBind(username)" />
```
```
  username: string = 'Priit Modanwal'
  twoWayDataBind(username: HTMLInputElement){
    this.username = username.value
    console.log(username)
  }
```
Here in this example #username is template variable and first bydefault value will me 'Priit Modanwal' and after can change when user enter something.

# One-way Data binding Vs Two-way Data Binding
- one-way Data Binding: can only bind data component to view.
- two-way Data Binding: can bind data component to view and vice-versa.

# Angular-Directive
- An Angular Directive is a special instruction in Angular that adds behavior or changes the appearance of elements in the DOM.
- (In short) An Angular directive is like a tool to control DOM behavior or styling directly from your component or HTML.
## Types of Directive: There are 3 main types
1. Component (also a directive)
2. Structural Directive
3. Attribute Directive
4. Custome Directive

<img width="1050" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-05 at 9 51 01 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfed832f-5386-47db-b389-8d390ceeb0a6" />
<img width="1255" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-05 at 9 53 01 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01778bc2-a304-4c7d-8ac6-1958e25f71b8" />

1. Component (also a directive)
- Technically a directive with a template.
- You use it with a custom tag like <app-login>.
- Load View inside the browser
```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-login',
  template: `<h1>Login</h1>`
})
export class LoginComponent {}
```

2. Structural Directive
- ➡️ Changes the structure of the DOM (adds/removes elements)
- New Versin - @If, @For, @Switch

| OLD Example | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `*ngIf`     | Adds/removes element by condition |
| `*ngFor`    | Repeats an element in a loop      |
| `*ngSwitch` | Switch-case logic in HTML         |

## If 
```
<p *ngIf="isLoggedIn">Welcome!</p>
<div *ngFor="let user of users">{{ user.name }}</div>
```
For new way no need to add any new module and all.
```
<!-- new way -->
@if (isLogged) {
    <h3>Hey New Way</h3>
}
```

##  If else
```
<!-- new way -->
@if (isLogged) {
    <h2>If New Way..</h2>
} @else {
    <h2>else if new way..</h2>
}
<!-- else condition -->
<h2 *ngIf="!isLogged">else If structural directive</h2>
@if (!isLogged) {
    <h2>else if new way..</h2>
}
```
# Ng Template
